# Alpha Zero Chess
For this Python Implementation of the AlphaZero Model of Google I combined the results of two other repositories(https://github.com/DylanSnyder31/AlphaZero-Chess and https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero)

I used the repository from Zeta36 for the setup of the Self Play and Optimizing Process of the Model. For interaction with a GUI i used the Implementation of DylanSynder31.

You can train the Model from Scratch or you can test the AI on GUI with the Play_Agent.py File.
